# Simple Directed Graph

## Description
This project implements a `SimpleDirectedGraph` class that models a directed graph (can also be undirected) with weighted or unweighted edges. It includes methods for adding and removing vertices and edges, checking for edges, and performing DFS and BFS traversals. Additionally, it supports advanced graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm, Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), finding maximum cliques, and finding an Eulerian circuit.

### Features
- Directed and undirected graphs.
- Weighted and unweighted graphs.
- Add and remove vertices and edges.
- Graph traversal using Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- Dynamic changes between directed and undirected graph types.
- Dynamic changes between weighted and unweighted graph types.
- Supports graph I/O with file-based creation.
- Weighted edge support for graphs.
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** for shortest path calculations.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** algorithm using Kruskal’s or Prim's algorithm.
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** for finding the least-cost path in a weighted graph.
- **Maximum Cliques** finding algorithm to detect cliques in an undirected graph.
- **Eulerian Circuit** detection in directed or undirected graphs.

### Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later.
